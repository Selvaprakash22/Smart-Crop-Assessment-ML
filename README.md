# Smart Crop Assessment and Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses Python and basic Machine Learning to recommend crops based on soil and weather conditions, and also simulate plant disease detection using image analysis concepts.

## Project Features

- Crop recommendation system using logistic regression
- Disease detection simulator for plant leaves
- Accuracy evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix
- Visualized results using seaborn and matplotlib
- Beginner-friendly code with dummy datasets (easy to upgrade later)

## Project Structure

Smart_Crop_Assessment_Project_FIXED.ipynb

Everything is inside one Jupyter Notebook (works in Google Colab).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Future Enhancements

- Replace dummy crop data with real soil datasets
- Add PlantVillage dataset for disease image training
- Deploy as web or Android app using Flask or React Native
- Add real-time weather API for dynamic predictions

## Sample Output

- Predicted best crop: Rice
- Simulated plant disease: Bacterial Spot
- Model Accuracy: 90%+ (sample simulation)

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run each cell step-by-step
3. View results and predictions
4. Customize with your own data or logic
